"""Probabilities from the normal distribution
Since each deal Amir worked on (both won and lost) was different, each was worth a different amount of money.
These values are stored in the amount column of amir_deals and follow a normal distribution with a mean of
5000 dollars and a standard deviation of 2000 dollars. As part of his performance metrics,
you want to calculate the probability of Amir closing a deal worth various amounts.

norm.cdf = normal distribution / cumulative distribution function.
norm.ppf = normal distribution / percent point function (inverse of cdf â€” percentiles)."""
